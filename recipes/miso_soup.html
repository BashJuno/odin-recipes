        Miso soup is a staple in Japanese cuisine and is soup for the soul. We enjoy it almost every single day for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. As a Japanese home cook, I would also say that miso soup is probably one of the easiest soups you can make at home.

        There are many paths to making miso soup, but once you know the basics, you will be able to branch out and customize. The goal of this post is to arm you with all the important knowledge so you can make yourself a bowl of authentic miso soup at home any time of the day. And trust me, what you make will taste 10,000 times better than the Japanese restaurants or the instant ones.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups water</li>
        <li>1 piece kombu (dried kelp) ((⅓ oz, 10 g per piece; 4 x 4 inches or 10 x 10 cm))</li>
        <li>1 cup katsuobushi (dried bonito flakes) ((packed; I used a loosely packed 3 cups in the video for stronger flavor))</li>
        <li>7 oz soft/silken tofu (kinugoshi dofu)</li>
        <li>4–5 Tbsp miso ((use 1 Tbsp, 18 g for every 1 cup, 240 ml of dashi))</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Preparation</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine water and dashi granules in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium and whisk in miso paste. Stir in tofu. Separate the layers of green onions, and add them to the soup. Simmer gently for 2 to 3 minutes before serving.
